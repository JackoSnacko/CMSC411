# CMSC411

This program simulates a RISC architecture pipelined processor. It prompts the user to specify the processing power of the components of the processor, then reads in a block of MIPS assembly code from a text file. The program then simulates running the assembly instructions through the processor, printing information on when each instruction line completes each stage (fetch, decode, execute, memory, write), as well as the registers and their contents.
